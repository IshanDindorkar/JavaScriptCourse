* JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, object-oriented programming language.

* JavaScript can be used at client and server side (thanks to nodejs)

* Multiple frameworks are available to support web developer using JavaScript

* Main building blocks of any web application -
** HTML - Content
** CSS - Presentation
** JavaScript - Dynamic Effects / programming

* 5 types of variable types -
** Number - floating point numbers
** String - sequence of characters
** Boolean - true or false
** Undefined - data type of a variable which does not have any value. It is data type in the begininning
** Null - 'non-existent'

* JavaScript has a feature called as dynamic typing - you don't have to give type of variable while defining

* Type Coercion - JavaScript dynamically convert type of variables, for example, converting number to string when concatenated with a string

* Variable mutation - JavaScript provides flexibility to change type of value stored in a variable. For example, variable age might be storing numeric value but later it can be made to store string value

* Operator precedence - check mozilla developer network(MDN) page to find out precedence among operators

* "===" -> operator that compares value of one variable with another variable

* How "==" is different from "===" -> "==" forces type coercion but "===" does not force type coercion and compares values only
